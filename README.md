# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

This is a simple command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe where a human player competes against an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.

The project was created as part of an academic exploration of adversarial search in artificial intelligence. It demonstrates core AI concepts such as optimal decision-making and game tree exploration.

## Features
- Human vs. AI gameplay
- Minimax algorithm for perfect play
- Modular design using Python classes
- Unit tests for core logic
